# Notes

## Time
Took me about 2 hours to write these automation tests
- E2E
- Random Quiz Answers
- Checking Shopping Links

## Waits
There are more waits in the tests then I like, but these were due to all the animations of the elements that take place in conjunction with elements not having unique ids. I would want to work with dev to get some unique ids that would help speed up the tests.
